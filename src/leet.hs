--   the foldr returns a function that when given an initial accumulator, does a left fold over the list with that accumulator
-- base case: empty list: just return the accumulator (id)
-- inductive step: k is a function that takes an accumulator and does a left fold over the tail of the list, startign with that accumulator
-- and the initial accumulator for the tail needs to be the result of applying f to our initial accumulator and the head of the list
-- so return a function that takes an accumulator z and return k (f z x) (a left fold over the tail of the list with (f z x) as the accumulator
-- really hard to understand this function if you try to manually step through the recursion, but relatively easy this way
