-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22403029/how-to-zip-lists-with-different-length
-- brilliant helper function from the community
-- because sometimes you want to your zip to keep going till both lists are empty
-- so just fill the padding in with mempty ish type values
zipWithPadding :: a -> b -> [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zipWithPadding a b (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zipWithPadding a b xs ys
zipWithPadding a _ []     ys     = zip (repeat a) ys
zipWithPadding _ b xs     []     = zip xs (repeat b)

-- a helper function I wrote wanting to zip when the values are Just, otherwise stop zipping
maybeZip ((Just x):xs) ((Just y):ys) = (Just x, Just y) : maybeZip xs ys
maybeZip _  _ = []
