-- In Haskell, the two use cases have been merged such that we
-- don’t call out constructor classes as being separate from typeclasses,
-- but we think it’s useful to highlight that something significant has
-- happened here. Now we have a means of talking about the contents
-- of types independently from the type that structures those contents.
-- That’s why we can have something like fmap that allows us to alter
-- the contents of a value without altering the structure (a list, or a Just)
-- around the value

-- you can't talk about Functor f without higher kinded types
-- f has to be something accepting one more parameter
-- without higher kinded types
-- like you can't even express this polymorphism
