-- single row will zip three locations together
-- prepending 0 and appending 0 to our list will give us some padding on the left and right 
-- so that we can safely add three values without worrying about out the edges
-- this put the bomb count on the neighboring tiles... not, the original bomb numbers
-- will still be there and will need to be cleaned up later by -> [new list] - [original list]
-- example  -> 
      -- [1,0,0,1] (original list)

      -- [1,1,1,1] (new list)

-- note, a good thing about singleRow function, using prepending + appending with zipwith3 is that
-- it cleans up after itself, it doesnt leave the padding after it calculates, meaning the input is the
